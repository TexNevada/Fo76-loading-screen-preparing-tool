You might ask yourself. What is F76LSPT / Fallout 76 loading screen preparing tool.

Have you ever wanted custom loading screens in Fallout 76? Well the way Fallout 76 works is that all photos you take in the game also becomes loading screens!
This is a simple folder that holds both an image and a thumbnail for the photo gallery. You can do all this manually by renaming a copy the images to thumbnail, changing color depth to 32 bit depth & resizing the thumbnails to a lower resolution ration. This however can be a hassle. Which is why I've made a tool that does all the resizing, bit depth changing & renaming for you!

Introducing F76LSPT / Fallout 76 loading screen preparation tool!

The program is open source so anyone can contribute or modify as they wish. As of now. There is no guides on how to move the files into the player folder but I'll be working on that when I get to it :)

# Important note
I would suggest using only 16:9 aspect ratio for custom images or else the thumbnails will become squished or stretched.

I do not know if it is possible to import custom images to PS4 or XBOX One. I would need confirmation on this.
